# Informatique ROB3 S5

## Description

This repository is organised based on the different TPs that they need to be delivered to the responsible professor. Every TPX folder (x stands for the identification number) comes with an advanced Makefile that makes executables for every program / exercise. Moreover, you will find anotated PDF files with the subjects of every TP.
